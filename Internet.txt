You are going to give a talk about the Internet.
You will have to start in 1.5 minutes and speak for not more than 2 minutes (10–12 sentences).
Remember to say:

• why today’s teenagers use the Internet so much;
• how the Internet makes long-distance communication easier;
• what dangers teenagers can face when they use the Internet;
• what your attitude to the Internet is.

You have to talk continuously.
