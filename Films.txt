Task 3. You are going to give a talk about films. You will have to start in 1.5 minutes and speak for not more than 2 minutes (10–12 sentences). Remember to say:

- what kinds of films modern teenagers enjoy;
- where you prefer watching films: on TV, on the Internet or in the cinema, and why;
- what film you have seen recently, what it was about;
- what your attitude to watching films as a way to spend your free time is.

You have to talk continuously.
